<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>People consider a place to be suitable for residence depending on several factors.
Some people might consider looking a neighbourhood which is rated to be one of the best neighbourhood for raising a family. The said neighbourhood should have several parks, schools, subway stations, Danforth Ave for restaurants, libraries with several fairs and events planned during summers. One might say these things can be found in all parts of Toronto but the affordability aspect need also to be considered. Accessibility of the neighbourhood from downtown and a good mix of residents from across the globe are among major factors. Some places might be easily accessible but not affordable depending on the income of family, and thus high shelter cost will only attract people with high level of income (Leslie &amp; Hunt, 2013).
Consequently, different categories of people have different priorities on places of residence. Some might prefer places which are near to the recreational ammenities such as beaches, and other places, whereas others might be looking for quite place (Zaami, 2015). All these depends on taste and preferences. Thus, some places might suits students, professionals, young families, and families. Besides, Such places are perfect for beach days, Canada Day fireworks, Boardwalk strolls. Also, the place is good for a runner since it is a perfect route from door, down the beach boardwalk and back down Queen for a solid 8km loop (Leslie &amp; Hunt, 2013). Therefore, several factors determine the population of the neighbourhood.</p>
